# Incident Post-Mortem: Concert Ticketing System Outage

## Incident Overview
- **Date**: May 31, 2025
- **Duration**: 2 hours 15 minutes
- **Impact**: Concert ticketing system experienced multiple outages affecting 3,500 users
- **Root Cause**: Database connection pool exhaustion during high-load period

## Timeline (All times in UTC+5)
- **13:45** - Initial alert: High latency detected in ticket booking endpoints
- **13:52** - Second alert: Backend service health checks failing
- **13:55** - SRE team began investigation
- **14:10** - Identified multiple backend instances restarting due to database connection timeouts
- **14:25** - Attempted first fix: Increased connection timeout values
- **14:45** - Issue persisted, deeper investigation revealed connection pool exhaustion
- **15:30** - Implemented fix: Adjusted pool size and implemented connection release improvements
- **16:00** - Services stabilized, monitoring confirmed recovery
- **16:15** - Incident resolved, all systems operational

## Impact
- 3,500 users affected
- 450 failed ticket booking attempts
- Estimated revenue impact: $15,000
- SLO violation: Availability dropped to 94.2% (below our 99.9% target)

## Root Cause
During a high-traffic period for a popular concert release, the following sequence occurred:
1. Increased user load led to more concurrent database connections
2. Connection pool reached its default limit (100 connections)
3. New requests queued up, leading to timeouts
4. Backend services started failing health checks and restarting
5. Cascading failure as restarting services created more connection attempts

## Resolution
Immediate fixes implemented:
1. Increased database connection pool size from 100 to 250
2. Added connection timeout handling and automatic release
3. Implemented circuit breaker pattern for database connections
4. Added connection pool metrics to monitoring

## Detection
- Primary detection through Grafana alerts:
  - Backend service health check failures
  - Database connection count metrics
  - Response time latency increase
- Secondary detection through user reports of booking failures

## Lessons Learned
### What Went Well
1. Automated health checks quickly detected the issue
2. Chaos testing had previously identified similar scenarios
3. Monitoring provided clear metrics for diagnosis

### What Went Wrong
1. Default connection pool size was not load tested
2. No circuit breaker in place for database connections
3. Lack of automated scaling for database connections

### Where We Got Lucky
1. Incident occurred during business hours
2. Database remained stable despite connection issues
3. No data corruption occurred

## Action Items
| Action Item | Type | Owner | Due Date |
|------------|------|-------|-----------|
| Implement dynamic connection pool sizing | Prevention | Database Team | June 7, 2025 |
| Add circuit breaker pattern | Prevention | Backend Team | June 5, 2025 |
| Update load testing scenarios | Detection | QA Team | June 10, 2025 |
| Improve automated recovery | Mitigation | SRE Team | June 15, 2025 |
| Review and update scaling policies | Prevention | Platform Team | June 20, 2025 |

## SLI/SLO Impact
| SLI | Target SLO | Actual During Incident |
|-----|------------|----------------------|
| Availability | 99.9% | 94.2% |
| Latency (95th percentile) | < 500ms | 2300ms |
| Error Rate | < 0.1% | 4.8% |
| Successful Bookings | 99.5% | 87.3% |

## Incident Severity Assessment
- **SEV-2** (Significant impact on business operations)
- Criteria met:
  - User impact > 1000
  - Revenue impact > $10,000
  - SLO violation > 4 hours

## Prevention
To prevent similar incidents:
1. Implement automated scaling for database connections
2. Add better monitoring for connection pool metrics
3. Set up automated failover for database connections
4. Regular load testing with connection pool scenarios
5. Update runbooks with connection handling procedures
