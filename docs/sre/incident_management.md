# Incident Management Procedures

## Incident Response Process

### 1. Detection
- Automated alerts from Prometheus/Grafana monitoring
- User reports through support channels
- System health checks

### 2. Classification
Based on impact and urgency:

| Severity | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| P0 (Critical) | Service outage, data loss | Complete system down |
| P1 (High) | Major feature broken | Cannot purchase tickets |
| P2 (Medium) | Performance degradation | Slow response times |
| P3 (Low) | Minor issues | UI glitches |

### 3. Response Steps

#### Initial Response (0-15 minutes)
1. Acknowledge alert/incident
2. Create incident channel in Slack
3. Assign Incident Commander (IC)
4. Begin incident log

#### Investigation (15-30 minutes)
1. Gather metrics and logs
2. Review recent changes
3. Identify affected components
4. Start timeline documentation

#### Mitigation (30-60 minutes)
1. Implement temporary fixes
2. Roll back recent changes if needed
3. Scale resources if required
4. Update status page

#### Resolution
1. Implement permanent fix
2. Verify monitoring
3. Update documentation
4. Schedule postmortem

### 4. Communication Templates

#### Initial Notification
```
INCIDENT ALERT

```

#### Update Template
```
